# All the News That's Fit to Scrape

### Overview

NewsScraper is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. Mongoose and Cheerio are used to scrape news from another site.

## What the app does

  1. Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to the application database.
  
  2. Users can leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database and associated with their articles. Users can also delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
